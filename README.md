# html-css-test

An HTML and CSS test for Code Immersives.

You'll be making a webpage with the requirements outlined below.

### General hints:

* You'll need to come up with some content, but this is a timed exercise, so try not to sweat what that content actually _is_ too much. [getlorem.com](http://www.getlorem.com) and [unsplash.com](http://www.unsplash.com) are your friends, here, and don't add any content you don't absolutely need to pass the requirements.

Speaking of which!

### Requirements

For __each__ of the items below, you'll need to style the tag in a __different__ way. _If you do not style an item, it will be marked incorrect_. What each style actually entails is up to you, but each requirement below is marked with a style number. As long as your styles are each different, and there's a style for each style below, you're good.

You should make:
* Two lists, __each in a div with an id__.
    * An ordered list of the letters A-G, with Style 1. Every second letter should have Style 2.
    * An unordered list of the numbers 1-7 with Style 3.
* An image that's a link with Style 4.
* An entire paragraph that's a link with Style 5. The link should open in a new tab/page.
* The following should all be in a new paragraph:
    * A link with Style 6. The link should change to Style 7 when you hover over it. The link should have __no underline__.
    * Two ems, one with no added style, one with Style 8.
    * a strong with Style 9.
    * a span with Style 10.
